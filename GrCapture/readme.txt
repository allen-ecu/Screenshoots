this app uses C# graphic method to screenshot and saves the jpg to disk,  
and uses js to load jpg into html canvas
15 frame per second as it is, 
however saving screenshot at 15fps to disk takes 0.778s
overwiring existing photos takes 0.871s (hard drive performance swings)
however saving screenshot at 30fps to disk takes 1.5s
overwiring existing photos takes 1.6s (hard drive performance swings)
in order to improve the performance, we need to find a faster way than taking screenshot(C#).
and hard dick speed affects the performance
still looking for a html way to screenshot, so we can save screenshot data in the memory rather than the hard disk.
